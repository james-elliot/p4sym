# p4sym, a solver for the connect-4 (puissance 4 in french) game

This program is quite "state of the art" regarding the use of symmetries 
and hash tables. 

It can solve the connect-4 game up to 7x7 given enough memory for the hash tables.
This Rust version is not as fast as the C version I wrote for my students at ISAE/Sup a√©ro. The difference in this version is aroung 10 to 20%.

Solving the "classical" 7x6 game takes around 7 minutes on an i9-9900K.
Parallelism is not used in the main branch. Working on it in the parallel branch.
