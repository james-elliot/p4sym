# p4sym, a solver for the connect-4 (puissance 4 in french) game

This program is quite "state of the art" regarding the use of symmetries and hash tables. 
It can solve the connect-4 game up to 7x7 given enough memory for the hash tables.
This Rust version is as fast as the C version I wrote for my students at ISAE/Sup a√©ro.
